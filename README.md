# Problem Statement
Our insurance company is experiencing increasing operational costs and fluctuating profitability, making it difficult to accurately forecast financial performance and identify areas for improvement. A lack of consolidated and actionable insights into claims trends, customer behavior, and policy performance hinders our ability to make data-driven decisions. We need to better understand the key drivers of our claims and revenue to optimize our underwriting processes, manage risks effectively, and improve customer satisfaction.

**Task**
- How can we precisely identify the drivers of escalating claims costs and extended processing times to significantly enhance operational efficiency?
- Are our current policies yielding optimal profitability across all customer segments, and how can we refine our underwriting and pricing strategies for sustained growth?
- What are the primary factors influencing customer churn versus retention, and how can we proactively leverage these insights to improve client loyalty and Lifetime Value?
- What anomalous patterns within claim data can we leverage to proactively detect and mitigate potentially fraudulent activities, thereby safeguarding our financial integrity?
